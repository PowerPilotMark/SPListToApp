# Integrating Power Apps Canvas Apps with SharePoint

We want to replace the SharePoint New, Edit, and Display Forms with a Power App Canvas App.

This will be accomplished by:
1. Creating a Power App that can utilize Deep Linking via the Param function
2. Creating a Redirect Page in Site Assets
3. Changing the NewFormUrl, EditFormUrl, and DisplayFormUrl to the Redirect Page using PnP PowerShell

## Getting Started

Please refer to [this article](https://github.com/PowerPilotMark/SPListToApp/wiki) to get you started.
